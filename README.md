# zero

**Keep your inbox at "only what still needs you," across every account, and never lose anything.**

A quiet macOS menu-bar app that reads each Gmail thread, sets aside everything that
isn't waiting on you, and keeps the rest one tap away. Nothing is ever deleted.

## What it is

Most "inbox zero" tools make you do the sorting. zero does the one part
you'd never finish by hand: continuously deciding what in your inbox is still an
**open loop** (something genuinely awaiting your action) and quietly setting
everything else aside.

It lives in the menu bar. You glance at it between meetings and see, across all
your accounts, the few things that actually need you. Everything else is archived
reversibly, so the inbox stops being a swamp without anything going missing.

**What it refuses to be:**

- An auto-replier. Replies are drafted in your voice on demand; you review, edit,
  and decide when (or whether) to send. It never sends on your behalf.
- A unified mail client. Your Gmail stays exactly as it is.
- A rule engine. There is no DSL, no regex, no filter list to maintain.
- A real-time tool. It runs once a morning.

## The panel

Four views, one icon in the menu bar:

| Open loops | Accounts | Undo | Settings |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ![Open loops](design/screenshots/panel-loops.png) | ![Accounts](design/screenshots/panel-accounts.png) | ![Undo](design/screenshots/panel-undo.png) | ![Settings](design/screenshots/panel-policy.png) |
| What still needs you, across all accounts | Per-account inbox and archive counts | Restore any day's archived mail in one tap | Your **Rules** (plain English), categories, daily schedule, and AI engine |

The panel is a dark "Raycast"-style liquid-glass overlay. Tap any thread to open
it in Gmail, hover it to **Reply** (drafts in your voice, stays local until you
tap Send) or **Set aside** (archived reversibly, immediately restorable).

## How it works

```
menu-bar app (SwiftUI)  -->  local server (keeper_server.py, 127.0.0.1)
                                 |  reads
                             app/state.json  <--  dashboard_state.py
                                 ^                (per-account status, open loops, undo points)
                                 |  Run / Undo
                             review_open_loops.py  (Claude Haiku + keep-policy.md)
                                 |
                             gws CLI  -->  Gmail (reversible label swaps only)
```

The Swift shell is deliberately thin: it starts the local Python server and
renders a native SwiftUI panel against its JSON API. All judgment runs in Python
with Gmail reached via the `gws` CLI. The panel reads a cached state file so it
opens instantly; it never talks to Gmail directly.

## Why you can trust it

Three properties, in priority order:

1. **Reversible by construction.** "Archive" means remove the INBOX label and add
   a dated recovery label (e.g. `zero/undo/2026-06-24`). Mail stays in All Mail,
   fully searchable. Any day's sweep restores in one tap from the **Undo** view.
   Nothing is ever deleted.
2. **Ambient.** No new app to live in. Your Gmail and Apple Mail stay exactly as
   they are. zero works quietly behind them, once a morning.
3. **The judgment is an agent, not a rule list.** What counts as "needs you" is
   written in plain English (see [keep-policy.md](keep-policy.md)) and enforced by
   Claude Haiku reading each thread in full. Cold outreach with a real person's
   name gets archived; a real person actually awaiting your reply is kept. A filter
   rule cannot tell those two apart.

## How "needs you" is decided

You edit one plain-language file, [keep-policy.md](keep-policy.md), or the
**Rules** section under the **Settings** tab in the panel. No regex, no DSL. The default:

> Keep a thread only if a real person is awaiting your reply or decision, there is
> an unanswered direct question or request addressed to you, a payment has actually
> failed, it is a legal or contractual matter, or there is an explicit deadline with
> a real consequence. Archive everything else reversibly.

Two signals settle most cases automatically:

- **Last message from you:** you already responded, the ball is in their court.
  Archive it.
- **Never replied to this sender, plus cold/sales content:** not a real loop, even
  with a person's name on it. Archive it.

When unsure, the policy keeps the thread. Everything archived is one tap away.

## Install & first run

### Quick install (recommended)

One command installs everything and launches the app:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drewling/zero/master/macapp/install-zero.sh | bash
```

It installs the prerequisites if missing (Homebrew → Python 3 / Node → the `gws` and
`claude` CLIs), copies `zero.app` to `/Applications`, **removes the macOS quarantine
flag** (required — see below), and opens it. Re-running is safe.

> **Why the quarantine step?** zero is signed ad-hoc, not notarized (no paid Apple
> Developer account). macOS quarantines *downloaded* un-notarized apps and Gatekeeper
> then refuses to launch them — so a hand-dragged DMG silently does nothing (a menu-bar
> app has no window, so the block is invisible). The installer strips the flag, the
> standard install path for un-notarized open-source Mac apps.

Then jump to [first run](#first-run-connect-your-gmail). Prefer to do it by hand? See
the manual steps below.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Install | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| macOS 26 (Tahoe, Apple Silicon) | — | Uses the native Liquid Glass API; Intel untested |
| Python 3 | `brew install python3` | Used by the local server and all judgment logic |
| `gws` CLI | `npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli` | Official Google Workspace CLI |
| `claude` CLI | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | Per-thread judgment and reply drafts |

### Step-by-step (app path)

1. **Install Node** (needed for `gws` and `claude`):
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

2. **Install the Google Workspace CLI and authenticate**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @googleworkspace/cli
   ```
   Create a free OAuth client at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/):
   - Enable the **Gmail API** on your project.
   - Configure the consent screen under **Google Auth Platform** (Audience: **External**).
   - **Set Publishing status to "In production"** — in "Testing" Google expires the
     token after 7 days, so sync silently dies after a week. You can skip verification.
   - **Clients → Create client → Desktop app** → download the JSON.

   See [docs/SETUP.md §3](docs/SETUP.md) for the exact click-path and the
   "unverified app" sign-in warning.

   Then authenticate (the `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_KEYRING_BACKEND=file` env var is required
   for headless/launchd contexts — without it, auth silently fails):
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_KEYRING_BACKEND=file gws auth login
   ```
   Repeat for each Gmail account you want to add, pointing `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_CONFIG_DIR`
   at each account's config directory.

3. **Install Claude Code CLI and log in**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   claude    # completes login on first run
   ```

4. **Download zero** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/drewling/zero/releases)
   and drag it to your Applications folder.

   > **First launch (required):** Because zero isn't notarized, macOS Gatekeeper blocks
   > the downloaded app — and on macOS 26 the old "right-click → Open" trick no longer
   > works for ad-hoc-signed apps. Remove the quarantine flag from Terminal:
   > ```bash
   > /usr/bin/xattr -cr /Applications/zero.app
   > ```
   > **Use the full `/usr/bin/xattr` path** — a Python/Homebrew `xattr` earlier in your
   > PATH may not support these flags and will silently fail, leaving the app blocked.
   > (The [quick-install script](#quick-install-recommended) handles this for you.)

5. **Open zero.** On first launch the onboarding screen asks you to paste your OAuth
   client JSON (downloaded in step 2), then opens a browser sign-in for each account.
   Nothing leaves your Mac.

6. **Run zero now.** Hit **Run zero now** in the app to tidy your inbox for the first
   time. To schedule it daily: `./bin/zero schedule`.

For the full step-by-step (including multi-account auth and CLI equivalents), see
[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).

### Build from source

Requires: Xcode command-line tools (`xcode-select --install`), macOS 26 (Tahoe, Apple Silicon).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drewling/zero.git
cd zero/macapp
./build.sh           # produces zero.app in macapp/build/
./make-dmg.sh        # optional: packages it as a .dmg
```

## Configuration

**One file.** Edit [keep-policy.md](keep-policy.md) directly or via the **Rules**
section under the **Settings** tab in the panel. Write it in plain English. No syntax to learn.

Everything else is optional and lives under **Settings**: your **categories**, the
**daily schedule** (what time, which days, whether macOS notifies you), how far back
to label archived mail, and which **AI engine** to use (Claude by default; Codex,
Hermes, or another agent CLI if you have one installed).

**Optional voice grounding.** Copy `knowledge/profile.example.md` to
`knowledge/profile.md` and fill it in. The drafter uses it as background when
composing replies in your voice. You can also create per-account files at
`knowledge/<account-slug>.md`. These files are gitignored and stay on your machine.

There is nothing else to configure.

---

## Privacy and trust

- **No project-operated backend.** Everything runs on your Mac. The only data that
  leaves your machine is per-thread text sent to the Claude API through your own
  `claude` CLI (for the keep/archive judgment and draft generation). See
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **The local server binds to `127.0.0.1` only.** Nothing is reachable from the
  network.
- **Nothing is ever deleted.** Archiving is a reversible label change. Mail stays
  in All Mail, fully searchable in Gmail.
- **Your data stays on your machine.** `accounts.json` and `knowledge/*.md` are
  gitignored and never committed.
- **Gmail access uses your own credentials.** The `gws` CLI authenticates with
  your Google account via OAuth; zero never handles your password or OAuth
  tokens directly.
