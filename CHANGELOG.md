# Changelog

All notable changes to zero are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.20] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **A failed "Add account" no longer blames the wrong thing.** When Google turned a sign-in away with a bare `access_denied` — which most often means the sign-in was cancelled, or the app's Google project hasn't been verified for the scopes it needs — zero would confidently tell you the OAuth consent screen was "Internal" or "in Testing," even when it wasn't. It now says that only when Google's response actually points at the audience or test-user settings, and otherwise shows the real error so you can act on it.

## [1.6.19] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **zero keeps itself up to date.** It quietly checks GitHub for new releases in the background and, when one is ready, shows a banner with a one-tap "Update now" and a "See what's new" link to the changelog — the update downloads, swaps itself in, and relaunches on its own. You can also check any time from the three-dot menu ("Check for Updates…"), which tells you when you're already on the latest version, and zero posts a notification once an update has been applied. Auto-checking can be turned off in Settings.
- **Links in email previews are clickable, and quoted history collapses.** Previews used to show the whole thread as one wall of text with dead links. Now the latest message is shown on its own with working links, earlier messages in the thread fold behind a "Show N earlier messages" toggle, and the quoted reply history under a message ("On … wrote:" and `>` lines) hides behind a caret you can expand — so a long back-and-forth reads as the one message that actually needs you.

### Fixed

- **The progress bar moves and says what it's doing.** A run could sit on "Sorting recent mail… 0%" the whole time and look frozen, even though it was working — with a single account there was nothing to move the bar and no detail while the slow part (reading each thread) ran. The bar now advances through real stages — "Reading mail (12 of 40)", then "Sorting with AI" — so you can see it's making progress.
- **No more Documents permission prompt freezing a run.** The first run after an update could stall behind a macOS "zero would like to access your Documents folder" dialog you might never see (a menu-bar app has no window to surface it). The classifier no longer reaches anywhere near your Documents folder, so the prompt is gone and runs start cleanly.

## [1.6.18] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Copy and paste work in the panel.** ⌘C, ⌘V, ⌘X, ⌘A, and ⌘Z had no effect anywhere in the panel, including the Google setup command during onboarding, so the only way to copy or paste was the right-click menu. The shortcuts now reach the focused field directly.
- **Setup no longer needs admin rights for the Google CLI.** On Macs where Node was installed system-wide, the installer hit a permission error trying to add the Google Workspace CLI and skipped it, leaving setup broken. It now installs into your home folder when the system location is locked down, no password required.

### Fixed

- **The panel reads the same over any window behind it.** The graphite that darkens the panel was layered *beneath* the frosted-glass effect, so a bright window behind it showed straight through and washed the panel and its text out to near-invisible, while over a dark window it looked solid. The tint now sits above the glass, so the panel is the same readable dark surface whatever is behind it, light or dark, with just a hint of glass shimmer.
- **First launch opens under the menu-bar icon, every time.** The very first open could still land in the bottom-left corner: the check that decided the icon was ready accepted its not-yet-placed position at the screen origin. zero now waits until the icon is genuinely in the menu bar before opening beneath it, and never drops the panel into a corner.

## [1.6.16] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **The panel opens under the menu-bar icon on first launch.** The very first time you opened zero it could appear floating in the middle of the screen instead of tucked under its icon; clicking the icon afterwards always placed it correctly. The first open happened before macOS had finished putting the icon in the menu bar, so there was nothing to anchor to yet. zero now waits for the icon to land, then opens beneath it.

### Changed

- **Steadier panel background.** The panel could look almost see-through over a light window behind it and noticeably more solid over a dark one. The surface is firmer now, so it reads consistently whatever is behind it, while keeping its glassy feel.

## [1.6.15] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Adding a Google account works again.** After signing in through Google you could hit "Couldn't add account: signed in but couldn't read the account email", with no way forward, on both the installer and the disk image. zero read your address from the sign-in tool's response by scanning for a single line of data, but the tool now prints that response across several lines, so the address always came back empty. zero now reads the whole response, and if an account genuinely cannot be read it shows the real reason (for example the Gmail API not being enabled) instead of a dead end.

## [1.6.14] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Drafting settings now save reliably.** Saving your sign-off name and house style could fail with "Couldn't save drafting name" and silently wipe the field. The Save button sends both fields at once, and the two requests raced over the same temporary file, so one crashed and clobbered the other. Saves are now serialized and use separate temp files, so both fields always persist.
- **The arrow above the panel now blends into it seamlessly.** The little arrow and the panel body were tinted by two separate layers that could never match, and the header sat on a darker fill than the rest, so a faint line showed at the top. The whole panel, arrow included, is now one continuous surface.
- **The repeated "zero would like to access files in your Documents folder" prompt is gone.** It came from a leftover scheduled task from an old development build that pointed inside the project folder. The app itself never needs your Documents folder.
- **Email previews read cleanly.** Long tracking links, rows of asterisks, and hard line breaks mid-sentence are tidied so a preview flows as normal text.

### Changed

- **Lighter, more even panel surface.** The panel no longer darkens toward the bottom, and the header and action bar share the one surface, for a calmer, glassier look that still holds its contrast over a bright window behind it.
- **Calmer shimmer.** The loading shimmer is dimmer, slower, and rests longer between passes.

### Improved

- **Mail you bring back stays back.** If zero set something aside and you restored it, the next run could quietly set it aside again. Restored conversations are now remembered and never re-archived, so zero stops fighting your choices.
- **Stops following a rule it should not.** A stale learned note could nudge zero toward archiving payment-failure alerts, which it should always keep. Learned notes are rebuilt cleanly each run so that cannot linger.
- **Steadier under load.** Saving settings, restoring mail, and a daily run can no longer step on each other's files, and a single account that fails to refresh no longer fails the whole run.

## [1.6.13] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **The menu-bar icon now reliably appears — the real fix.** For a version or two the icon was invisible for some people, and stayed invisible no matter how the app was relaunched. The cause turned out to be subtle: macOS remembers, per app, whether your menu-bar icon is shown or hidden, and a first-launch crash in an earlier build left that setting stuck on "hidden" for zero specifically. Once stuck, nothing the app did could bring the icon back. zero now ships under a fresh app identity, which clears that stuck state for everyone — the icon shows on launch as it should. The ⌥⌘Z shortcut to open zero from anywhere, and opening the panel on whichever display you're actually using, are included too. (Because the app identity changed, macOS asks once more for permission to show notifications.)

## [1.6.12] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **zero now always shows itself on first launch, even when the menu bar can't display its icon.** A menu-bar app's only UI is its icon, and on a full menu bar (or under the notch on newer MacBooks) macOS can give that icon no on-screen slot — the app runs but shows nothing, looking dead. zero now detects this and centers its panel on screen instead of staying hidden, pops the onboarding panel automatically on first launch, and re-shows the panel whenever you re-open the app from Finder or Spotlight. The icon is also put up immediately on launch, before any first-run disk work or server start, so it can never be delayed or hidden by setup.

### Changed

- **Accurate Google setup instructions, verified against the current console.** The README, in-app onboarding, and `docs/SETUP.md` now reflect Google's current "Google Auth Platform" console and — critically — tell you to set the OAuth app's publishing status to **In production**. In "Testing" status Google expires the refresh token after 7 days, which would silently stop zero from syncing about a week after setup. Verification (with its annual third-party audit) is not needed for personal use.
- **Release and install instructions no longer hit the quarantine trap.** The Gatekeeper step now uses the absolute `/usr/bin/xattr` path — a Python or Homebrew `xattr` earlier in your PATH doesn't support the recursive flag and silently fails, leaving the app blocked — and points at the one-command installer.

## [1.6.11] - 2026-06-25

### Changed

- **Daily routine settings, rethought for how you actually set them.** The schedule now leads with a plain-language summary you can read at a glance ("Runs every weekday at 7:00 AM"), with the time and days editable right beneath it. The hour/minute is a native, type-able time field instead of click-one-at-a-time arrows. The separate cards for the grace window, run notification, and archived-mail labeling are merged into a single "Run options" card with clean hairline rows, so the section reads as three clear groups, what runs, how it behaves, and the one-time backlog clear, rather than a stack of equal-weight boxes.

## [1.6.10] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Drafting preferences in Settings.** A new "Drafting" section lets you set the name zero signs your replies with (leave it blank to keep using each account's own name), and a free-form "house style" zero follows in every draft it writes: tone, length, sign-off, spelling, whatever you want. These apply across all accounts, on top of the voice zero already learns from your sent mail.

## [1.6.9] - 2026-06-25

### Changed

- **Label cleanup now reports its status in the bottom bar, like every other operation.** Removing labels used to be tracked only inside its own sheet, so closing the sheet or the panel lost any sign of progress. It now runs through the same job pipeline as running, sorting, and clearing backlog: the bottom status bar shows "Removing N labels…" then "Removed N labels", the status survives closing the window, and you get the same completion notification. Partial failures are reported honestly ("Removed 8 · 1 couldn't be removed") instead of a generic error.

## [1.6.8] - 2026-06-25

### Changed

- **"Clean up labels" now shows where each label came from.** Labels are grouped into three sections: the ones zero applies as it sorts, your own labels that were already on the account, and Gmail's built-in labels (shown for reference, with friendly names like "Promotions" rather than "CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS"). Gmail's own labels can't be selected or removed, and "Select all" only ever touches the removable ones, so it's clear at a glance what you would and wouldn't be removing.

## [1.6.7] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Read and open set-aside emails from the Undo tab.** The emails inside a recovery batch now behave like open loops: tap one to read its full content in place, or "Open in Gmail" for the whole thread. Restoring an email also puts it straight back into Open loops, where you'd expect to find it again, rather than silently into the inbox where you'd have to go hunting.

## [1.6.6] - 2026-06-25

### Changed

- **"Sort recent mail" and "Clean up labels" are now two separate actions.** They were crammed into one sheet, which was confusing because they do opposite things: sorting *adds* category labels to recent mail, cleaning up *removes* them. Sorting is now its own item in the account's menu (pick the last 7, 30, or 90 days); cleaning up labels stays a focused sheet that only removes labels.
- **Honest, consistent status for sorting and backlog clearing.** If one account couldn't be reached, the job no longer fails wholesale and throws away what it did. It now reports the real outcome ("Labeled 42 recent threads · 1 account couldn't be reached"), the same way label removal already reported partial results, and only treats it as a failure when nothing at all succeeded. Progress for these jobs now also shows on the Accounts tab where they're started, not only on Open loops.

### Fixed

- **More robust label and sort internals.** Replaced guard-then-force-unwrap patterns in the optimistic UI updates with safe optional access, so a state change mid-operation can't trip a fatal unwrap.

## [1.6.5] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Read a message without leaving the app.** Tap any open loop to expand a read-in-place preview of the email's latest message, fetched on demand, scrollable, and selectable. It's enough to know the whole content at a glance, with "Open in Gmail" one click away for the full thread. Not a full mail client by design.

### Changed

- **Smoother, more native tab switching.** The four tabs now live on a single horizontal track that slides on one spring, the way native macOS panes move, instead of tearing each view down and rebuilding it. Switching tabs is calmer, and each tab keeps its own scroll position and any expanded previews instead of resetting every time.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **The Undo tab shows the actual emails now.** Each day's set-aside mail is a batch you can open to see the real emails inside (sender, subject, and when), and put any single one back in the inbox with one tap, alongside the existing "Restore all". The emails load on demand when you open a batch; large batches show the most recent with a clear count of how many more "Restore all" would recover.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-06-25

### Changed

- **Run notifications are now native and clickable.** The "set aside / still need you" notification is posted by zero itself instead of through AppleScript, so it carries the app icon, and clicking it opens the panel straight to **Open loops**. Previously the notification had no icon and its Show button opened the Script Editor. Scheduled morning runs now notify too, with the same behaviour — before, only manual runs did.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **The engine "Connected to" chip now follows the engine you select.** When you switched AI engine (for example Claude to Codex), the confirmation chip kept naming the previous engine, because it read the server's stale "active" flag rather than your selection. It now tracks the selected engine, shows a brief "Verifying…" state while it re-checks that the engine is installed and reachable, then confirms "Connected to <engine> · <version>" (or flags it as not detected). Switching engines is a no-op if you tap the one already selected.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **The selected tab now renders cleanly.** The active segmented-nav tab (e.g. "Accounts") was drawing as a washed-out, half-rendered glass pill with dimmed text, because it stacked a fill plus a glass surface inside a glass container that no longer had a sibling glass layer. It is now a crisp raised pill (subtle fill, hairline rim, soft shadow) on a gently sunken track, sliding between tabs, with the active label at full brightness.

### Changed

- **Clearer documentation.** The README now names the fourth tab correctly (Settings, which holds Rules, categories, the daily schedule, and the AI engine), uses the current `zero/undo/` recovery-label example, and lists what lives under Settings. SECURITY.md opens with a plain-language privacy summary.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-25

A depth release: the learning loop actually closes, labeling reaches your archive, the engine is provider-agnostic, the panel seam is gone, and the whole surface is more consistently glassy. The product landing page is rebuilt and live.

### Added

- **Works with the AI engine you already use.** The engine is now a data-driven provider abstraction: Claude runs today, and Codex, Hermes, or any other agent CLI is used automatically if it's installed and selected. Adding a new engine is a single data entry, not a code change. Unavailable engines are clearly shown as "Not detected" and can't be selected into a broken state.
- **Labeling now reaches your archive.** A new "also label archived mail from the last N days" setting (`label_archived_days`, default 30) sorts recently-archived mail into your categories too, so there's always plenty labelled, not just the inbox. Off, 7, 30, 90, or 365 days. Idempotent: already-labelled threads are skipped.
- **Beautiful API documentation.** The local engine's JSON API is now documented with a Scalar reference site (`docs/api/`), framed clearly as a local, private, contributor-facing API. Added `docs/MAINTENANCE.md` so the docs, settings, and release process stay in sync across future work.

### Changed

- **Auto-learned preferences actually close the loop.** zero now also learns "archive more like this" from the senders you repeatedly dismiss (recurring senders only, so one-offs don't become noise), and voice learning refreshes right after you send an edited draft instead of waiting for the next run. Learned preferences feed both the keep/archive judgement and the draft voice.
- **Settings redesigned for calm.** The "Learned from your actions" section breathes properly (optically aligned rows, comfortable empty state, clean multi-group headings); Daily routine is now cohesive cards instead of card-plus-loose-rows; the category emoji/colour token reads as two clear taps; the Intelligence engine rows are balanced and the "connected" note is grouped.
- **Label cleanup is reassurance-first.** The cleanup sheet leads with "only labels are removed, your mail is never deleted", distinguishes zero-created labels from your own, and reports partial results ("Removed N, M couldn't be removed") instead of a blanket success.
- **More consistently glassy.** Removed a double-glass layer in the segmented nav, moved the emoji/colour popovers and the "sent" confirmation onto real material, and introduced a named corner-radius system (`Radius`) for concentric, inset-rounded corners throughout.
- **Landing page rebuilt and published.** A sharper "Three questions it asks for you" how-it-works (the questions the agent answers on your behalf), a before/after inbox visual, a heavyweight standalone trust section, and tighter copy. It is live and auto-deploys.

### Fixed

- **The panel pointer seam is gone.** The little arrow at the top of the panel now shares the header's exact graphite material, with no seam or tint break where it meets the body. (It was rendering with a different, lighter glass than the header.)
- **Fewer transient inbox errors.** Calls to the Google Workspace CLI now retry rate-limit, 5xx, and network blips with exponential backoff, so a momentary hiccup no longer surfaces as "HTTP request failed". Category labeling now counts and reports failures instead of swallowing them silently.

### Maintenance

- Claude is no longer added as a git co-author (set globally).
- Genericized a leftover personal email address in a design mock.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-25

Polish and connect-flow fixes from hands-on testing of 1.5.0.

### Fixed

- **Connecting a Gmail account now actually opens your browser.** With no terminal, the `gws` sign-in helper printed the Google consent URL and waited instead of launching a browser, so "Opening your browser to sign in…" hung forever. zero now reads that URL, opens it for you, and shows a fallback "Open the sign-in page" link. (Verified end to end: a real consent tab opens.)
- **The action bar no longer repeats itself.** During a run, the live progress message showed both in the button and in the status line beside it. The button now shows a short "Working…" and the live detail appears once, in the status line (which has more room as a result).
- **Daily-routine layout.** "Run at" no longer collapses into vertical letters; the section is now three clean rows: the run time, the day-of-week pills, and the "Weekdays" / "Every day" presets. The preset pills no longer wrap.
- **Colour picker sliders.** The Hue/Saturation/Brightness thumbs are vertically centered and track the cursor across the full width without clipping the track ends.
- **Top-bar menu.** The three-dot overflow menu no longer shows a stray focus ring when the panel opens, nor an accent-filled highlight while open.

### Changed

- Updated the README screenshots to the current 1.5.x panel.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Configurable daily routine.** Settings now lets you choose when the keeper runs (hour and minute), which days of the week, and whether macOS notifies you when a run finishes. Changing the schedule regenerates the launch agent automatically, with no terminal.
- **AI engine settings.** A new "Intelligence" section shows which agent SDK zero is connected to (Claude, with its version), backed by a provider abstraction (`lib/llm.py`) so judgement and drafting both route through one place. Codex and Hermes are listed on the roadmap and shown as not-yet-available until wired.
- **Quit from inside the app.** An overflow menu in the panel's top bar (showing the version) and a right-click menu on the menu-bar icon both offer "Quit zero". Left-click still toggles the panel.
- **Replies use your Gmail signature.** Drafts now append your account's default Gmail `sendAs` signature to the HTML part. If you have none, drafts are unchanged.
- **Witty drafting messages.** While a reply is being written, the composer cycles through short, changing loading lines instead of a static one.
- **10 new moments of delight** during normal use: a calm "inbox at zero" arrival, rolling counts, a satisfying archive dissolve, the run button morphing into live progress, refined row hover, the composer rising into place, a "sent" confirmation, spatial tab transitions, a refresh sheen, and a first-paint cascade. All respect Reduce Motion.
- **Resilient first run and sign-in.** The panel now shows a calm "Starting…" state while the local engine boots (it no longer blocks or looks like onboarding), and the local server starts listening immediately instead of waiting on a state rebuild. Connecting a Gmail account opens your browser automatically, offers a fallback "Open the sign-in page" link, can be cancelled at any time, and times out instead of hanging.

### Changed

- **The "What to keep" box is now "Rules"** and is always pre-filled with sensible starter rules on a fresh install.
- **Categories editor redesigned.** Each category is a unified emoji + colour token; the colour picker is a curated palette plus an in-app hue/saturation/brightness control. The macOS system colour picker is never opened.
- **New app icon:** a Google-blue squircle with a bold check, in the native macOS style.
- **Landing page re-laid-out** for balance: a two-column hero with a larger app mock, varied section rhythm, an asymmetric trust section, and richer per-account chips.
- **Setup is documented end-to-end.** The README now has one numbered install-and-first-run path with the correct `@googleworkspace/cli` package and the required `gws auth login` (with `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_KEYRING_BACKEND=file`) and Claude CLI steps. The architecture doc was rewritten to describe the current app and local service.

### Fixed

- **Undo (Cmd-Z) works in the reply editor** and no longer reverts your manual edits when you adjust or regenerate a draft.
- **"Couldn't check your inboxes / HTTP request failed" clears itself.** The local service rebuilds a stale failed state on launch instead of serving it indefinitely, so a transient error no longer sticks across restarts. (`GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN` is still stripped defensively in every path.)
- **Sign-in no longer hangs.** Connecting an account could get stuck on "Opening your browser to sign in…" forever: the sign-in helper, with no terminal, printed its consent URL instead of launching a browser, and timed-out attempts leaked stray processes. zero now reads that URL and opens the browser itself, kills the whole process group on cancel or timeout, and reports accurate errors (it only shows the OAuth-setup guidance when credentials are genuinely missing).
- **UI polish:** the colour picker's H/S/B sliders are vertically aligned and track the cursor; the schedule preset pills ("Weekdays" / "Every day") no longer wrap; and the top-bar overflow menu no longer shows a stray focus ring when the panel opens.

### Removed

- The legacy Slack review pipeline (`slack_app/`, the deploy installer and daemon plist) and its shell wrappers, plus unused modules (`build_briefing.py`, `draft_one.py`, `undo_inbox_zero.py`, `gate_audit.py`, `test_gate.py`, `verify_archive.py`) and orphaned bytecode.
- The legacy `claude -p TRIAGE.md` step from the daily run (and `TRIAGE.md`, `fetch_inbox.sh`, `ensure_labels.sh`). The scheduled run now uses the same keeper engine as the app.
- An internal org name from a source identifier (`drewl_profile` is now `user_profile`).

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- zero now strips a stray `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CLI_TOKEN` from the environment before invoking `gws`, in the server, the spawned gws environment, and `bin/zero`. If that variable was set (for example exported from a shell profile), gws treated its value as a pre-obtained access token; a malformed value broke every account with `HTTP request failed: builder error: failed to parse header value`. zero uses per-account keyring credentials and never a global token, so it drops the variable defensively.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

- **Renamed to `zero`.** The app, bundle identifier (`com.drewling.zero`), CLI (`bin/zero`), and repository are now `zero`. On first launch the app migrates your existing `~/Library/Application Support/inbox-keeper` data — accounts, policy, learning, and state — to the new location, so nothing is lost across the rename.
- Converted the remaining flat-fill surfaces to real macOS 26 Liquid Glass: the top and action bars, the segmented-nav track, list-row and icon-button hovers, the composer strips, and error banners now use the native `.glassEffect` material, with a soft scroll-edge effect on the loops list. The deliberate legibility floor and the branded buttons are unchanged.

### Added

- **Time-windowed controls:** label-only backfill that sorts recent mail into categories, a reversible "clear the backlog before a date" sweep, and a first-run backlog step.
- **In-app Google setup.** A new user can paste their Google OAuth client (`client_secret.json`) directly in onboarding instead of hand-placing a file; the browser sign-in follows. This removes the biggest first-run hurdle to using zero on a fresh Mac. (New `POST /api/set-credentials` and `GET /api/credentials-status` endpoints.)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

- Major legibility pass for text over the glass: raised the glass surfaces' dark-tint floor so text keeps contrast even when something bright shows through, brightened the dim secondary/tertiary text tiers, and switched progress lines, links, counts, and hover icons from the dark blue accent (which never cleared WCAG 4.5:1 as text) to the lighter `accentSoft`. Text sitting directly on the panel vibrancy now carries a faint dark halo so it stays readable on any backdrop.
- The reply composer and label-cleanup sheet now use real Liquid Glass (tinted dark enough to stay legible) instead of a flat opaque panel.

### Fixed

- The reply composer's draft text was a dark ink left over from the old light-background web editor, rendering nearly invisible on the dark composer. It's now light ink, and links use the legible `accentSoft`.

### Removed

- The legacy browser web panel (`app/panel/`) and its `bin/zero dashboard` command. The native macOS app is now the sole front-end; `keeper_server.py` remains as its JSON API backend. Also removed two unused review scripts and de-duplicated the category defaults shared by the server and dashboard state.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- Cute emoji picker and colour picker for categories in Settings: tap a category's emoji to choose from a curated grid (or type your own), and tap its colour swatch to pick from a soft palette (system picker still available for off-palette colours).

### Changed

- The "Tidying your inboxes" state no longer takes over the whole panel: it's now a slim progress banner pinned atop the loops list, so the inbox stays visible and scrollable while the keeper runs.

### Fixed

- Smoothed the menu-bar panel's pointer arrow: removed a thin white seam where the arrow met the body (opposite path windings were cancelling), and reshaped it as a gentle raised-cosine bump that flows out of the panel edge.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- Per-account label cleanup: review an account's labels in a checklist (app-created ones pre-selected) and bulk-delete the ones you don't want. Mail is never deleted — labels only.
- Real Gmail profile photos displayed as circular avatars throughout the panel.
- Editable categories applied as Gmail labels and surfaced as loop tags in the panel.
- Categories editor in Settings for managing per-account category sets.
- 10 Liquid-Glass delight moments: ambient animations, spring transitions, and haptic cues.

### Changed

- Settings tab redesigned with cleaner layout and a redesigned "Learned from your actions" section.
- App now runs from `~/Library/Application Support` (TCC-safe, location-independent); no longer requires a source checkout to be present.
- De-personalized internal identifiers to remove hard-coded personal references.

### Fixed

- `photo_url` decoding fix: avatars now load reliably for accounts with encoded profile URLs.
- Orphaned-label-on-rename fix: renaming a category no longer leaves stale Gmail labels behind.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-24
