"""Roll the user's action signals into a readable learning/learned.md.

Reads learning/signals.jsonl (see lib/learning.py), nets out undone dismissals,
and asks Haiku to distil one short section:
  - Draft voice notes  (how the user edits the system's drafts)

A second short "Keep more like this" section is written from restore signals
(keeper-archived threads the user explicitly undid) — these are genuine
corrections, not routine triage.

Archive-by-default patterns are intentionally excluded: the user sets mail
aside because there's nothing to action, not to teach a rule. Generating
"archive LinkedIn by default" from routine triage filled learned.md with noise.

The result is written to learning/learned.md. It is plain markdown the user
can read and edit. With too few signals it writes nothing.

Usage: learn.py [--min 2]
