## How to build

### Prerequisites

- macOS 26+ (Apple Silicon)
- Xcode command-line tools: `xcode-select --install`
- Python 3
- `gws` CLI authenticated for at least one Gmail account
- `claude` CLI configured

### Build the menu-bar app

```bash
cd macapp
./build.sh          # compiles zero.app into macapp/build/
```

To produce a distributable disk image:

```bash
./make-dmg.sh       # produces zero.dmg in macapp/
```

### Run the server standalone (faster dev loop)

You do not need the macOS app running to work on the Python layer. Start the
server directly:

```bash
python3 lib/keeper_server.py
```

The server binds to 127.0.0.1 and serves the JSON API the native app uses.
Use `./bin/zero run` to trigger a sweep from the command line, or `POST
/api/run` to the server.

For Gmail operations you need `accounts.json` configured (see the
`accounts.json.example` template) and `gws auth login` run for each account.

### Dry-run the judgment logic

`review_open_loops.py` runs dry by default (no changes applied):

```bash
python3 lib/review_open_loops.py <gws_config_dir> <account_label>
```

Pass `--execute` to apply label changes. Use this to iterate on the judgment
logic and the `keep-policy.md` prompt without touching production mail.

## Repo layout

```
lib/                   Python server and scripts (the core)
  keeper_server.py     Local HTTP server (stdlib only, no deps)
  review_open_loops.py Per-thread keep/archive judgment (calls claude CLI)
  dashboard_state.py   Builds app/state.json from Gmail + learning store
  inbox_zero.py        gws wrapper and thread operations
  learning.py          Keeps-rule learning and inference
  ...

macapp/                SwiftUI menu-bar app (thin shell)
  Sources/             Swift source files
  build.sh             Build script (produces .app)
  make-dmg.sh          DMG packaging

app/
  state.json           Cached state (gitignored, written at runtime by dashboard_state.py)

keep-policy.md         The plain-English keep policy (the only user config)
accounts.json          Per-account registry (gitignored, from accounts.json.example)
knowledge/             Optional voice-grounding files (gitignored)
docs/                  Architecture and pipeline docs
```

The judgment pipeline is: Swift app starts `keeper_server.py`, which spawns
`review_open_loops.py` per account, which calls the `claude` CLI (Haiku) with the
thread contents and `keep-policy.md`, then applies reversible label changes via the
`gws` CLI.

## Coding conventions

**Match the style of the file you are editing.** The codebase has a consistent
voice; do not introduce a different style in the same file.

**Python (lib/):**

- Stdlib only for `keeper_server.py` and the core server path. No third-party
  dependencies in the hot path.
- Use subprocess calls to `gws` and `claude` CLIs the same way existing code does.
  Do not add SDK imports that are not already there.
- Keep functions short and named after what they do, not how they do it.

**Swift (macapp/):**

- The Swift shell is deliberately thin. If something can be done in Python (where
  the logic already lives), do it there. Only put things in Swift that genuinely
  need native macOS integration.
- Match the SwiftUI patterns already in `Sources/`.

**General:**

- Make surgical changes. One logical change per PR; do not refactor adjacent
  code in the same diff unless you have a specific reason.
- Dry-run first. For any Gmail operation, verify behavior with `--execute` off
  before turning it on.
- The keep policy is the product. Changes that blur the reversibility guarantee
  or that add irreversible side effects need a very strong justification.

## Proposing changes

1. Open an issue first for anything beyond a clear bug fix or small improvement.
   Describe the problem you are solving, not the solution. This avoids duplicate
   work and lets us align on scope before you write code.
2. Keep PRs focused. One fix or feature per PR.
3. Include a brief test plan in the PR description: how you verified the change
   works and does not break anything. A dry-run log, a before/after inbox count,
   or a screenshot of the panel is usually enough.
4. The core invariant is that nothing is ever deleted and every archive is
   reversible. Any PR that risks that property will not be merged.

## API docs

The `docs/api/openapi.json` spec is hand-written (no codegen). When you change an
endpoint — path, parameters, request body, response shape — update it manually. Validate:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool docs/api/openapi.json >/dev/null && echo OK
```

Preview the Scalar render locally:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory docs/api
open http://localhost:8080
```

See `docs/MAINTENANCE.md` for the full list of what to keep in sync on each change.

## Releasing

> This section is for maintainers.

Before running `bin/release`:

1. Bump the version in `macapp/Sources/zero-Info.plist` (`CFBundleShortVersionString`).
2. Add a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section to `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog 1.1.0).
   Move items out of `## [Unreleased]` into the new section.
3. Commit and **push `master`** (the script only pushes the tag, not the branch):
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```
4. Run the release script:
   ```bash
   bin/release X.Y.Z
   ```
   The script verifies the working tree is clean on `master`, confirms the changelog
   section exists, builds the `.app` and `.dmg`, creates and pushes the `vX.Y.Z` tag,
   publishes a GitHub release with the changelog notes and `.dmg` attached, then
   installs the new app to `/Applications/zero.app`.

**Known caveat — unsigned/un-notarized binary.** The `.dmg` is not signed or notarized.
